🧠 Memory Card Flip Game

A visually engaging Memory Card Flip Game built using HTML, CSS, and minimal JavaScript.
The project emphasizes advanced CSS animations and layout techniques, while JavaScript is used only for essential game logic such as card matching, shuffling, and timer control.


📌 Project Description

This game challenges players to flip cards and find matching pairs.
Each card uses a 3D flip animation, image-based card faces, and a clean grid layout.
Cards are randomly shuffled on every reload, and a timer runs during gameplay and stops automatically when all cards are matched.


🛠️ Technologies Used

1. HTML5
   
-> Semantic structure (header, main)
   
-> Reusable card components

-> data-value attributes for match comparison

2. CSS3
   
-> CSS Grid for layout
   
-> 3D transforms (perspective, rotateY, preserve-3d)

-> Transitions and hover effects

-> Keyframe animation for matched cards (pulse effect)

-> Image scaling and responsive design

3. JavaScript (Minimal Usage)
   
-> Card flip handling
   
-> Match validation logic

-> Random card shuffling 


✨ Features

🎴 3D card flip animation

🖼️ Image-based card backs

🔀 Random card positions on every restart

✅ Matched cards remain flipped with pulse animation

🚫 Click lock during card comparison

🎨 Smooth hover and interaction effects



🧠 How the Game Works

1. Click on a card to flip it
   
2. Flip a second card to check for a match
  
3. If cards match:
 
4. They stay flipped
 
5. A pulse animation plays

6. If cards do not match:
   
7. Both cards flip back automatically
