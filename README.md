🧠 Memory Card Flip Game

A visually engaging Memory Card Flip Game built using HTML, CSS, and minimal JavaScript.
The project emphasizes advanced CSS animations and layout techniques, while JavaScript is used only for essential game logic such as card matching, shuffling, and timer control.

📌 Project Description

This game challenges players to flip cards and find matching pairs.
Each card uses a 3D flip animation, image-based card faces, and a clean grid layout.
Cards are randomly shuffled on every reload, and a timer runs during gameplay and stops automatically when all cards are matched.

The project is designed with a strong focus on CSS-driven visuals and clean separation of concerns.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Keyframe animation for matched cards (pulse effect)

Image scaling and responsive design

JavaScript (Minimal Usage)

Card flip handling

Match validation logic

Random card shuffling using CSS order
